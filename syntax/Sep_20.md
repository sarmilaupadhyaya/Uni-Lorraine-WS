Outline

A brief history of Grammatical Formalisms

-GF properties
	- Criteria for grammarical formalisms
-CFG




1. Introduction
Each researcher has own kind of grammar formalisms
Different theories= different formalisms
When we have GF, one goal is to go to the semantics of it.


### Grammar formalisms ###
	- TAG, TREE ADJOINING GRAMMAR: instead of working on character and words, idea is to work in tree to get the structure we want. 
	- CG, Categorical Grammar: 
	- LFG and HPSG
	- MG ( and MTT)

EXAMS: 2 hours , exercises same as in tutorials, January, 



# GRAMMAR FORMALISMS #


## Grammar ##
	representation of structures of Natural lanaguage, trying to distinguish well formed and not well formed structures of langauge.
	Grammars without formalisms? 
## Formalism ##
	mathematical representation of the strucuture of langauge
	Informal Defination: if Subject, verb and object
	S => SUVOB
	a subject followed by verb or objects
	linguistic representation of mathematical properties

# NLP #
## NLU ##
	Text =>Morphology => Syntax =>Semantics => Pragmatics
	parsing-> given a string of symbol, using formal grammar to find its structure
## NLG ##
	Text <= Morphology <= Syntax <=Semantics <= Pragmatics

final state automata is simple formalisation for morphology

# Describing Natural Language #

belongs to linguistic and we wanna work in the processing strucuture to produce calculus.
how to process text using calculus


# Natural Language #

- no official set of gramamtical rules. 
- how our brain use language to express our idea

# NLP #
 Difficuly
 anytime we get a formalisation we want to use for parsing and generation. Resource need for two task is completely different. 

# NL as a generative system #

	
# Syntax #

Syntactic theory in two ways: Psychological and COmputation way. In first, language is assumed to be something in peoples mind.

# Syntactic Analysis #

	first we need to understand how sequene of words are combined to form a grammatical sentence.
	Constituent (unit of internal syntactic structure): unique coherent group of words

# Constituency Tests: Modification #

CT: Replacement
CT: Movement, when you move the group of words somewhere 
CT: Stand Alone, sentence fragment


Phrase Structure
- TP -> NP VP

- Determiner Phrase? example

# Why study syntax #

	useful for parsing, generation and grammar checking

	working in syntax =  study of real time working of the brain. Hence, map syntax to congintive process. Example: Ambiguity management
