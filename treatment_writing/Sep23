## 	Introduction to stochastic grammars


- Probability od a tree is product of probability of all the rules required to construct it

- similarly, probability of getting all child from single parent when summed would be 1

- Given a grammar and tree corpus C, the probability of a rule r_i per se is:


- N(r_i)/sum of all the number of rules which has same left hand side as the r_i



#Practice

#Given a following sentences: bac, bccac, bac, bccccac, da, dcca, dccca, dccc
#

S=>bc, ccac

Hence, probability of bcccac, would be 0.5*0.5*0.5*0.22*0.57*0.277= 0.004354
